# nosqlmedia

## Description

This project was intended to create a back end for a social media website using NoSql and Mongoose. First I created the models, which are User and Thought. After that I created the controller functions that actually create the user or thought. Those then get assigned to their own routes in a separate routes directory. User can look for all users or thoughts, or look for them by their id. The user can also create, update or delete users or thoughts. 

## Installation

To run this application the following are required: 
  -Express.js
  -Mongoose.js
